# Authoring3HW1

# Goals
This repo will be used to build a Node-based video application using queries and databases. This will also contain the app file that executes the project (via conditional rendering and back end templates).
# Future Requirements
1. Update the folder structure for the application (refer to class examples).
2. Use NPM to add and save dependencies / modules.
3. Create and run your app.js file using Node / Express; implement routing and rendering
with EJS (or another rendering engine)
4. Retrieve and filter data / populate views from a database using the mysql module and
server-side rendering
5. Load and play video on a thumbnail click; show that videoâ€™s details page with reviews,
stars, non-functional social media icons etc
6. Create a repo and push your development branch to it. Your
master branch will be the base build; we will be adding branches based on modules
and functionality.
